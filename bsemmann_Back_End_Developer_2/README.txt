Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
Create the back end java class and began writing the getState and getWinner methods used to 
retrieve the state and the winner of the election in that state with one simple call to 
one of these methods.

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
In week 1 I implemented the getState and getWinner methods different than we were intending
on using them for our program. So this week I rewrote those methods to account for the 
how the others are planning on using those methods to call from other parts of the code
like the front end developers driver.

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
<Replace this with a list your contributions for the week 3 deliverable.
You can list the java files that you wrote and committed during the first week,
or the data files your created or worked on. If you haven't written any code or
other content that your can commit, provide a list of the work that you did
during week 3. Make sure that all your week 3 contributions and this section
of the readme are committed and pushed to the GitHub repo by the week 3 deadline
on 12/08 at 11:59pm CST.>

Files written by me:

BackEndElectionMap.java

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<If you have any files written by you or your team in your submission that were
written for an earlier project and that you re-used for project four, replace this
text with a list of these files. Provide file name and path as well as the project
that they were originally developed for.>

Web address at which the program is available:
----------------------------------------------
<If you and your team have written a web app that is available on the internet,
replace this text with its address. This is not a requirement of Project Four
and you will not loose points for not implementing a web application or for not
having a running version on the web.>

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
<List any additional notes for the grader here (only required by the final deadline).>
