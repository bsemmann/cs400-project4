Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
Create the back end java class and began writing the getState and getWinner methods used to 
retrieve the state and the winner of the election in that state with one simple call to 
one of these methods.

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
In week 1 I implemented the getState and getWinner methods different than we were intending
on using them for our program. So this week I rewrote those methods to account for the 
how the others are planning on using those methods to call from other parts of the code
like the front end developers driver.

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
I added more get methods so the front end devolper could easily grab the data from the
states ArrayList of data and use that in their html implementation. I also updated those 
methods for the new data given to us by the data wrangler
