Contributions Week 1:

I reviewed creating a custom website using CGI while also looking into advanced CSS/JSS and Javascript techniques to make our project what can be expected of a CS400 project.

NOTE: I did not deliver on my deliverable promised in the proposal. I will make sure it is definitely part of my week 2 delivery.

<Replace this with a list your contributions for the week 3 deliverable.
You can list the java files that you wrote and committed during the first week,
or the data files your created or worked on. If you haven't written any code or
other content that your can commit, provide a list of the work that you did
