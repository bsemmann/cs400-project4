Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
I reviewed creating a custom website using CGI while also looking into advanced CSS/JSS and Javascript techniques to make our project what can be expected of a CS400 project.

NOTE: I did not deliver on my deliverable promised in the proposal. I will make sure it is definitely part of my week 2 delivery.

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
I created electionMap.html

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
I replaced electionMap.html with MyWebpage.java as I needed to use a CGI script to create a webpage that use multiple java classes.
I replaced the placeholder election data in the webpage with the methods provided by the BackEnd, all of which is in MyWebPage.java now.
